          This PR touches UI or documentation files. Please ensure the following accessibility requirements are met before merging.

          > ⚠️ **AI tools are not perfect.** Always verify with VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS, and keyboard-only navigation. This checklist is a starting point, not a substitute for real assistive technology testing.

          ### Checklist

          - [ ] \`@accessibility-lead\` has reviewed all UI changes ([install agents](https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents))

          - [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA minimums (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI components/focus indicators)
          - [ ] ARIA roles and states are used correctly (prefer native HTML semantics first)
          - [ ] Focus management is correct for dialogs, modals, and dynamic content
          - [ ] All images have meaningful alt text (or \`alt=\"\"\` for decorative images)
          - [ ] Forms have associated \`<label>\` elements and clear, programmatically-associated error messages
          - [ ] Markdown documentation passes \`@markdown-a11y-assistant\` review (if \`.md\` files changed)
          - [ ] Changes tested with at least one screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA, or JAWS)
