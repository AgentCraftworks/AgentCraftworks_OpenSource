# AgentCraftworks Architecture

This document describes the full end-to-end architecture of AgentCraftworks — from GitHub events to agentic remediation.

## SDLC Lifecycle Context

Architecture decisions in this repository align to a staged SDLC strategy:

- Greenfield ideation and rapid prototyping
- Validation and staging hardening
- Productized promotion flow and governance
- Production operations and incident response

See `docs/SDLC_LIFECYCLE_STRATEGY.md` for the lifecycle model and when to activate stricter repo policy and infrastructure controls.
